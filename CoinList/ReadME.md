#CoinList

This file contains the list of coins/tokens chosen by different measures. it has three columns:
First: The category of coin/token
Second: coin/token ticker
Third: how risky the coin/token is

## Criterias of being included in this list
There are a couple of criterias by which each coin/token is inspected; including:
- How innovative and applicable the project is
- The advantages relative to other projects
- How decentralized/centralized the project is
- How decentralized/ centralized, advantageous/disadvantageous is
- The team leading the project
- Investors
- Tokenomics
- Github developers and contributions
- Marketing plans
- Primordiality

The next step is defining the riskiness of each project. Riskiness is measured by:
- Market capitalization ( less than 50 million dollars makes a project a high risk one)
- Tokenomics (amount of token release/airdrop)
- Project lifetime
